Write an SQL query to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than 10000. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of theÂ amounts of all transactions involving that account.

Return the result table in any order.

``` sql
SELECT *
FROM
    (SELECT name, SUM(amount) AS balance
    FROM Users AS u
    JOIN Transactions AS t
    ON u.account = t.account
    GROUP BY t.account) AS CTE
WHERE CTE.balance > 10000;
```
