    "You have `n` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and \n",
    "`runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `ith` robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and \n",
    "costs `runningCosts[i]` units to run. You are also given an integer `budget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)`, \n",
    "where `max(chargeTimes)` is the largest charge cost among the `k` robots and `sum(runningCosts)` \n",
    "is the sum of running costs among the `k` robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **maximum** number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not \n",
    "exceed `budget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.\n",
    "To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.\n",
    "It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.\n",

    "Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.\n",
