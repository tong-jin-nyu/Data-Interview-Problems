    "You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose 2 distinct names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.\n",
    "2. Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB` with each other.\n",
    "3. If both of the new names are not found in the original ``ideas``, then the name `ideaA` ``ideaB`` (the concatenation of `ideaA` and `ideaB`, separated by a space) is a valid company name.\n",
    "4. Otherwise, it is not a valid name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ideas = [\"coffee\",\"donuts\",\"time\",\"toffee\"]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The following selections are valid:\n",
    "- (\"coffee\", \"donuts\"): The company name created is \"doffee conuts\".\n",
    "- (\"donuts\", \"coffee\"): The company name created is \"conuts doffee\".\n",
    "- (\"donuts\", \"time\"): The company name created is \"tonuts dime\".\n",
    "- (\"donuts\", \"toffee\"): The company name created is \"tonuts doffee\".\n",
    "- (\"time\", \"donuts\"): The company name created is \"dime tonuts\".\n",
    "- (\"toffee\", \"donuts\"): The company name created is \"doffee tonuts\".\n",
    "Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some examples of invalid selections:\n",
    "- (\"coffee\", \"time\"): The name \"toffee\" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.\n",
    "- (\"time\", \"toffee\"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.\n",
    "- (\"coffee\", \"toffee\"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ideas = [\"lack\",\"back\"]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10`\n",
    "- `1 <= n, m, capacity <= 105`\n",
    "- `ideas[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- All the strings in `ideas` are unique.\n",
