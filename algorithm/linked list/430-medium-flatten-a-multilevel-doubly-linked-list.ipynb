    "You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `head` of the first level of the list, **flatten** the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let `curr` be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after `curr` and before `curr.next` in the flattened list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the `head` of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to `null`.\n",
