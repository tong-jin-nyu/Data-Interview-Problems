    "# 1845 Seat Reservation Manager\n",

    "Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `SeatManager` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.\n",
    "- `int reserve()` Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.\n",
    "- `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat with the given `seatNumber`.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input\n",
    "[\"SeatManager\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\"]\n",

    "Output\n",
    "[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\n",
    "seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.\n",
    "seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].\n",

    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= n <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `1 <= seatNumber <= n`\n",
    "- For each call to `reserve`, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.\n",
    "- For each call to `unreserve`, it is guaranteed that `seatNumber` will be reserved.\n",
    "At most `10^5` calls in total will be made to `reserve` and `unreserve`.\n",
