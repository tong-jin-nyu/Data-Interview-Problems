    "There are some prizes on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `prizePositions` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, where `prizePositions[i]` is the position of the `i^th` prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be `k`. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example if `k = 2`, you can choose segments `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and you will win any prize i that satisfies `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3` or `2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4`.\n",
