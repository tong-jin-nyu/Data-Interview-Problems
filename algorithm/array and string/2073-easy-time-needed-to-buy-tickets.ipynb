    "There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0^th` person is at the front of the line and the `(n - 1)^th` person is at the back of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `i^th` person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.\n",

    "Return the time taken for the person initially at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The queue starts as [2,3,2], where the kth person is underlined.\n",
    "After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,2,1] at 1 second.\n",

    "Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,1] at 5 seconds.\n",
    "Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.\n",

    "Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0\n",
