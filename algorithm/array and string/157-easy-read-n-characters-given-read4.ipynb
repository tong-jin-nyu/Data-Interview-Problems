    "The API `read4` reads four consecutive characters from `file`, then writes those characters into \n",
    "the buffer array `buf4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the number of actual characters read.\n",

    "Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\n",
    "Note that \"abc\" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.\n",
