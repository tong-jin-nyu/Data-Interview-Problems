    "You are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take `n` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]`describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `i^th` train ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if the `1st` train ride takes `1.5` hours, you must wait for an additional `0.5` hours before you can depart on the `2nd` train ride at the 2 hour mark.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or `-1` if it is impossible to be on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed `10^7` and `hour` will have at most two digits after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: At speed 1:\n",
    "- The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.\n",
    "- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n",
    "- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.\n",
    "- You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: At speed 3:\n",
    "- The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.\n",
    "- Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.\n",
    "- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.\n",
    "- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.\n",
