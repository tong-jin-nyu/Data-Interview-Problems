    "You are keeping the scores of a baseball game with strange rules. At the \n",
    "beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith`\n",
    "operation you must apply to the record and is one of the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An integer `x`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score of `x`.\n",
    "- `'+'`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.\n",
    "- `'D'`.\n",
    "  - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.\n",
    "- `'C'`.\n",

    "Output: 30\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].\n",
    "\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].\n",
    "\"D\" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].\n",
