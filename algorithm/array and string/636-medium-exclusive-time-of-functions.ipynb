    "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `\"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\"`. For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `\"1:end:2\"` means a function call with function ID `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.\n",

    "![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/05/diag1b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\n",
    "Output: [3,4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n",
    "Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n",
    "Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n",
    "Output: [8]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n",
    "Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n",
    "Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\n",
    "Output: [7,1]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n",
    "Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n",
    "Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n",
    "Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n",
    "Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n",
