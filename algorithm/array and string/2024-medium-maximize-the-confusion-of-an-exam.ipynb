    "A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting `true` and `'F'` \n",
    "denoting `false`. He wants to confuse the students by maximizing the number of consecutive \n",
    "questions with the same answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `ith` \n",
    "question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform \n",
    "the following operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of consecutive `'T'`s or `'F'`s in the answer key after performing the \n",
    "operation at most `k` times.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: answerKey = \"TTFF\", k = 2\n",
    "Output: 4\n",

    "Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = \"FFFT\".\n",
    "Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = \"TFFF\".\n",
    "In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.\n",

    "Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = \"TTFTTTTT\". \n",
