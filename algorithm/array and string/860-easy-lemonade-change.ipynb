    "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade cost `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and \n",
    "order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and \n",
    "pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer \n",
    "so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `$5`. \n",

    "if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.\n",
    "From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\n",
    "From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.\n",
    "For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\n",
    "For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.\n",
