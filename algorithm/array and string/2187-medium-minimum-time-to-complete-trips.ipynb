    "# 2187 Minimum Time to Complete Trips\n",

    "You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `i^th` bus to complete one trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. \n",
    "  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n",
    "- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. \n",
    "  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.\n",
    "- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. \n",
    "  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n",
    "So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.\n",
    "So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= time.length <= 105`\n",
    "- `1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 107`\n",
