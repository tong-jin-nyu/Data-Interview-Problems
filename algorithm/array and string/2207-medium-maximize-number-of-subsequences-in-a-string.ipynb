    "You are given a 0-indexed string `text` and another 0-indexed string `pattern` of length `2`, both of which consist of only lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add either `pattern[0]` or `pattern[1]` anywhere in `text` exactly once. Note that the character can be added even at the beginning or at the end of `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of times `pattern` can occur as a subsequence of the modified `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: text = \"abdcdbc\", pattern = \"ac\"\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "If we add pattern[0] = 'a' in between text[1] and text[2], we get \"abadcdbc\". Now, the number of times \"ac\" occurs as a subsequence is 4.\n",
    "Some other strings which have 4 subsequences \"ac\" after adding a character to text are \"aabdcdbc\" and \"abdacdbc\".\n",
    "However, strings such as \"abdcadbc\", \"abdccdbc\", and \"abdcdbcc\", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences \"ac\" and are thus suboptimal.\n",
