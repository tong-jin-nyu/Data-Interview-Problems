    "You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, `plantTime` and `growTime`, each of length `n`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plantTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes to plant the `ith` seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed consecutively. However, the planting of a seed is not completed until you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.\n",
    "- `growTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes the `ith` seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the beeginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 9\n",
    "Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.\n",
    "One optimal way is:\n",
    "On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.\n",
    "On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.\n",
    "On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.\n",
    "Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.\n",

    "On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.\n",
    "Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.\n",
