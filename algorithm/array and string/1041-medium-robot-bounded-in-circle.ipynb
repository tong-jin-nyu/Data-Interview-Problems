    "On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.\n",
    "- The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.\n",
    "- The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.\n",
    "- The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot can receive one of three instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"G\"`: go straight 1 unit.\n",
    "- `\"L\"`: turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).\n",
    "- `\"R\"`: turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.\n",

    "Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).\n",
