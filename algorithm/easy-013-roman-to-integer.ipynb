    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n",

    "There are two methods: \n",

    "1. Per the instruction, we need to subtract values if we encounter one of those six instances. This method involves addition as default and subtraction when special cases apply.\n",

    "First, a string can be sliced because it is an array. A string of roman numerals can be splitted and sliced into a group of single letters. The base logic is to write a for-in loop to add all letters together.\n",

    "However, there are exceptions. In our cases, there are six special instances where subtraction is involved. Each instance is a combination of two Roman letters. If we still apply the for-in loop, we will get a wrong answer. To solve this, we can replace those instances with single dummy letters. For example, we can define `d = 9` and assign every `XL` to `d` if `XL` exists in our string. \n",
