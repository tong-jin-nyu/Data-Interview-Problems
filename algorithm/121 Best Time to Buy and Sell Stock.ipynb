    "You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy the stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the *maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]\n",
    "Output: [5]\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.\n",
    "Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]\n",

    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n",

    "The trick of this problem lies in efficiency. At first glance, the problem can be solved by simply using two embedded loops. This was also my first attempt. \n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        if len(prices) == 1:\n",
    "            return 0\n",
    "        elif len(prices) == 2:\n",
    "            if prices[0] <= prices[1]:\n",
    "                return prices[1] - prices[0]\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                return 0\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            for i in range(len(prices)-1):                   # the first loop\n",
    "                prices[i] = max(prices[i+1:]) - prices[i]    # the embedded loop\n",
    "            if max(prices[:-1]) <= 0:\n",
    "                return 0\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                return max(prices[:-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when processing large arrays, this algorithm becomes extremely slow. The time complexity is $O(n^{2})$. To prevent time-out, we need to find another way. A good solution is dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "prices = [10, 2, 20, 1, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each price in the `prices` array, we can get its maximum possible profit (0 if negative):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "maximum_profit = [0, 18, 0, 2, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we buy the stock at day 2 (price = 2) and sell at day 3 (price = 20), we will get the maximum profit for day 2, which is 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, we understand that the goal is to find a lowest price such that the maximum possible profit of that price is the largest. To achieve this, we create a `lowest` variable to store the lowest price. It gets refreshed as we loop through the array. We also create a `profit` variable to store the maximum possible profit. It also gets refreshed. The process can be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "prices = [10, 2, 20, 1, 3]\n",
    "lowest = [10, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n",
    "profit = [0, 0, 18, 18, 18]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, we assume that the first `price` is the lowest: `lowest = prices[0]`. The `profit` is set to 0. Starting from day 2, we compare the `price` with `lowest` and refresh the `lowest` if `price` is smaller. We also calculate the maximum possible `profit` by taking the difference between `price` and `lowest`. If the difference is larger than the previous maximum possible `profit`, we replace the `profit` with the difference. As we loop through the `prices`, the `lowest` will always be equal or lower while the `profit` will always be equal or larger. At the end of the loop, we'll get the maximum `profit` value."
