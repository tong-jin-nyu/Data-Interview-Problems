## Question 

Let's say we have 1 million app rider journey trips in the city of Seattle. We want to build a model to predict ETA after a rider makes a ride request.

How would we know if we have enough data to create an accurate enough model?

## Hint

Are there any metrics that we could use to baseline how well a model developed off the data would actually perform?

## Notes

- How much error in the ETA is acceptable?
- RMSE
- Check the distribution and see if it fits a normal
- Generalizability of the model
- R-squared: how many variations can be explained by the model?
- Log likelihood ratio
- AIC
- BIC
